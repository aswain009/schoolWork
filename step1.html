  <h1>Step 1: Set Up Your Environment</h1>
  <p>The first step in building a website in HTML is to set up your environment. This involves installing the necessary software and tools on your computer.</p>
  <h2>Install a Text Editor</h2>
  <p>The first tool you'll need is a text editor. This is where you'll write your HTML code. There are many text editors to choose from, but some popular options include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
    <li>Sublime Text</li>
    <li>Atom</li>
    <li>Notepad++</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Choose the text editor that works best for you and install it on your computer.</p>
  <h2>Create a Folder for Your Project</h2>
  <p>Once you have your text editor installed, create a new folder for your project. This is where you'll save all the files for your website. Choose a name for your folder that is descriptive and easy to remember.</p>
  <h2>Start a New HTML File</h2>
  <p>Open your text editor and start a new file. Save it with the extension ".html" in your project folder. This will be the main HTML file for your website.</p>
  <p>Now you're ready to start building your website! Continue to <a href="step2.html">Step 2: Create Your HTML File</a>.</p>
